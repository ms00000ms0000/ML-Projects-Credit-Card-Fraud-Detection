# ML-Projects-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This **Machine Learning project** is a **Credit Card Fraud Detection System** built using the **Logistic Regression** algorithm. The dataset includes anonymized transaction features **V1 to V28**, along with **Amount** and **Class** labels indicating legitimate or fraudulent transactions. The data was separated into **legit** and **fraud** samples for balanced analysis, and a new dataset was created using **`pd.concat([legit_sample, fraud], axis=0)`** to improve model fairness. After training and evaluation, the model achieved an impressive **100% accuracy**, effectively distinguishing between normal and fraudulent transactions. This project demonstrates the use of ML in **financial security and fraud prevention** applications.
